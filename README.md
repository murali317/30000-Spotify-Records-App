## Dataset Choice

**Dataset:** Spotify Tracks CSV

- This is chosen for its real-world relevance, variety of fields (track, artist, album, genre, popularity, etc.), and suitability for demonstrating table features like filtering, sorting, and bulk actions.
- The dataset is easy to parse and large enough to showcase performance and UX features.

## Technology Decisions & Trade-offs

- **React + TypeScript:** Modern, type-safe, and widely adopted for robust UI development.
- **Vite:** Fast dev/build tool for React projects.
- **TanStack Table v8:** Powerful, flexible table logic (sorting, filtering, pagination, selection, resizing, etc.).
- **TailwindCSS:** Utility-first CSS for rapid, responsive, and themeable UI.
- **PapaParse:** Fast CSV parsing and export.
- **Context API:** For global theme management (dark/light mode).
- **Trade-offs:**
  - TanStack Table is more complex than basic table libs, but enables advanced features and performance.
  - Tailwind requires utility class learning, but results in maintainable, scalable styles.
  - No backend: all data is client-side for simplicity and demo purposes.

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

- **No persistent storage:** All changes (delete, selection) are in-memory only.
- **No backend integration:** All data is loaded from CSV; no live updates or multi-user support.
- **No undo for delete:** Deleting rows is permanent for the session.
- **No advanced analytics:** Only table-based features are implemented.
- **Accessibility:** Basic ARIA labels are present, but further improvements possible.
- **Column management:** Only resizing is implemented; column reordering and advanced visibility management could be added.
- **Testing:** No automated tests included.
- **Performance:** Handles large CSVs well, but not optimized for 10k+ rows.
